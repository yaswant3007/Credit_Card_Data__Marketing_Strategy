### Performances and Key Insights [Credit_Card_Data__Marketing_Strategy]

In our analysis of credit card customer data, we utilized a K-means clustering model to identify distinct groups within the customer base. The model classified customers into four clusters, each exhibiting unique behaviors and financial characteristics. This segmentation enables us to tailor our marketing strategies effectively to target specific customer needs and maximize profitability. Here are the key insights from each cluster, in order:

#### Cluster 0: One-Off Purchasers (21% of Total Customers)
- **Behavior**: This cluster primarily makes one-off transactions, exhibits the lowest payment ratios, and has lower credit scores.
- **Strategy**: This group is considered high-risk. They use the card minimally, possibly just for utility bill payments. We need to:
  - Monitor their activity closely due to the risk associated with low payment ratios.
  - Implement measures to mitigate potential losses, such as credit counseling or payment reminders.

#### Cluster 1: Cash Advance Users (23% of Total Customers)
- **Behavior**: These customers rely heavily on cash advances, make minimal payments, and possess poor credit scores. They do not engage in purchase transactions.
- **Strategy**: This group is riskier but can be targeted by:
  - Offering lower interest rates on purchase transactions to encourage a shift from cash advances to regular purchases.

#### Cluster 2: High Monthly Purchasers (31% of Total Customers)
- **Behavior**: Customers in this cluster have the highest average monthly purchases and engage in both installment and one-off transactions. They also maintain a comparatively good credit score.
- **Strategy**: This group represents a valuable segment with high purchasing activity and good credit behavior. We recommend:
  - Increasing their credit limit or lowering interest rates to encourage further spending.
  - Offering premium or loyalty cards to incentivize more transactions.

#### Cluster 3: Installment Purchasers (25% of Total Customers)
- **Behavior**: Customers in this cluster have the highest credit scores, pay their dues on time, and primarily make installment purchases.
- **Strategy**: This is the best-performing group. To maintain and enhance their engagement:
  - Offer rewards points to encourage more purchases and maintain their high credit scores.

### Summary
Our K-means clustering model has effectively segmented the customer base, allowing us to develop targeted marketing strategies. By addressing the unique needs and behaviors of each cluster, we can enhance customer satisfaction, increase transaction volumes, and manage risk more effectively.
